# Zeit-Scraper
### Description
This project downloads every new article from zeit.de in xml, scrapes it and writes the data in a csv table.
My inspiration was a [talk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-YpwsdRKt8Q) from David Kriesel on 33c3. This project
runs on my Synology Diskstation and is executed every 2 hours.

### Installation
